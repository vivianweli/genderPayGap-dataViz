<h2> 1. WHAT the visualizations show </h2>

<ul>
    <li>The visualization shows the gender pay gap in the technology industry in the USA using a race track metaphor.</li>
    <li>It demonstrates how three gender groups (Men, Women, and Non-Binary individuals) progress toward higher salaries at different "speeds."</li>
    <li>It shows salary milestones.</li>
    <li>It incorporates variables of education level and years of experience as factors affecting the pay progression.</li>
</ul>

<h2> 2. WHO the visualization is for </h2>

<ul>
    <li>Students at all educational levels (middle school through university).</li>
    <li>Anyone interested in understanding gender-based wage disparities in tech.</li>
    <li>Visual learners who prefer graphical explanations.</li>
    <li>Young people exploring future career paths.</li>
    <li>Anyone wanting to understand wage inequality through an accessible metaphor.</li>
    <li>Teachers using it as an educational tool for discussing workplace disparities.</li>
    <li>Parents/mentors teaching about workplace equality.</li>
</ul>

<h2> 3. WHY we the audience should care about it </h2>

<ul>
    <li>In tech jobs, people get paid differently just because of their gender.</li>
    <li>Even when women and men have the same education and work experience, women only move up in pay at 60% of the speed of men. Non-binary people move up at 80% of men's speed.</li>
    <li>Over time, these differences in pay get bigger and bigger.</li>
    <li>This means women and non-binary people earn much less money throughout their working lives.</li>
    <li>These pay differences can affect what jobs people choose, how they ask for raises, and how companies make rules about pay.</li>
    <li>It's important to fix these unfair differences so everyone gets paid fairly for their work.</li>
</ul>

<h2> 4. HOW to read the visualization </h2>

<ul>
    <li>The three parallel tracks represent different gender groups, each with distinct salary progression speeds:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Blue track: Baseline pace.</li>
        <li>Pink track: Reduced pace.</li>
        <li>Grey track: Intermediate pace.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>These tracks dynamically adjust based on the selected education level and years of experience, allowing users to visualize how career progression and salary growth vary among groups with identical qualifications.</li>
    <li>Dropdown menus at the top enable filtering by education level and years of experience. Stick figures on each track visually represent the typical compensation for each gender group.</li>
    <li>The finish line represents the salary milestone.</li>
    <li>The note at the bottom indicates these are annual averages in USD.</li>
</ul>
