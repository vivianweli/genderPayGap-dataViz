    <h2 class="modal-header">1. WHAT the visualizations show</h2>
    <ul class="modal-list">
        <li>The visualization shows the <strong>gender pay gap</strong> in the <strong>technology industry</strong> in the USA using a <strong>race track metaphor</strong>.</li>
        <li>It demonstrates how <strong>three gender groups</strong> (Men, Women, and Non-Binary individuals) progress toward higher salaries at different "<strong>progress</strong>".</li>
        <li>It shows <strong>salary milestones</strong>.</li>
        <li>It incorporates variables of <strong>education level</strong> and <strong>years of experience</strong> as factors affecting the <strong>pay progression</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="modal-header">2. WHO the visualization is for</h2>
    <ul class="modal-list">
        <li><strong>Students</strong> at all educational levels (middle school through university).</li>
        <li>Anyone interested in understanding <strong>gender-based wage disparities</strong> in tech.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual learners</strong> who prefer graphical explanations.</li>
        <li><strong>Young people</strong> exploring future career paths.</li>
        <li>Anyone wanting to understand <strong>wage inequality</strong> through an accessible metaphor.</li>
        <li>Teachers using it as an <strong>educational tool</strong> for discussing <strong>workplace disparities</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Parents</strong>/<strong>mentors</strong> teaching about <strong>workplace equality</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="modal-header">3. WHY we the audience should care about it</h2>
    <ul class="modal-list">
        <li>In <strong>tech jobs</strong>, people get paid differently just because of their <strong>gender</strong>.</li>
        <li>Even when women and men have the same <strong>education</strong> and <strong>work experience</strong>, women only move up in pay at <strong>60%</strong> of the speed of men. Non-binary people move up at <strong>80%</strong> of men's speed.</li>
        <li>Over time, these differences in pay get <strong>bigger</strong> and <strong>bigger</strong>.</li>
        <li>This means women and non-binary people earn much <strong>less money</strong> throughout their working lives.</li>
        <li>These pay differences can affect what <strong>jobs</strong> people choose, how they ask for <strong>raises</strong>, and how companies make rules about <strong>pay</strong>.</li>
        <li>It's important to fix these <strong>unfair</strong> differences so everyone gets paid <strong>fairly</strong> for their work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="modal-header">4. HOW to read the visualization</h2>
    <ul class="modal-list">
        <li>The three parallel tracks represent different gender groups, each with distinct <strong>salary progression speeds</strong>:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blue track</strong>: Male.</li>
            <li><strong>Pink track</strong>: Female.</li>
            <li><strong>Grey track</strong>: Non-binary.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>These tracks adjust dynamically based on the selected <strong>education level</strong> and <strong>years of experience</strong>, allowing users to visualize how career progression and salary growth vary among groups with identical qualifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Dropdown menus</strong> at the top enable filtering by <strong>education level</strong>.</li>
        <li>Users scroll up and down to increase or decrease <strong>years of experience</strong>.</li>
        <li>Stick figures on each track visually represent the typical <strong>compensation</strong> for each gender group.</li>
        <li>The <strong>finish line</strong> represents the salary milestone in that educational level across all years of experience.</li>
        <li>The note at the bottom indicates these are annual averages in <strong>USD</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
